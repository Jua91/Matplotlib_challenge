Study on potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)

![bar_chart1](figures/bar_chart1.png)

In the study, the maximum period of treatment was 45 days. The tumor volume and metastatic sites were regularly measured at intervals of 5 days. In addition, 249 mice started the regimen treatment (at timepoint 0), but only 130 went through the 45-day treatment.

Looking into gender, almost identical numbers of female and male were studied. 125 mice were male and 124 were female.

At the beginning of the study, all the mice had the same tumor volume of 45mm3 regardless of the regimen. Of the four most promising treatment regimens, the capomulin treatment was the most effective because the mice treated with capomulin had the lowest tumor volume at the end of the treatment. The tumor volume decreased from 45mm3 to 36mm3.

The slope of 1.01 and the correlation coefficient value of 0.95 indicates that there's a strong positive relationship between mouse weight and tumor volume. In other words, the mice with larger tumor volume weighed more in the study.
